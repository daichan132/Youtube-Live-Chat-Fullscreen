# README Style Guide

## Common Mistakes

- **No install steps** - Never assume setup is obvious
- **No examples** - Show, don't just tell
- **Wall of text** - Use headers, tables, lists
- **Stale content** - Add "last reviewed" date
- **Generic tone** - Write for YOUR audience

## Prose Quality

For general writing advice — clear prose, Strunk's rules, and AI patterns to avoid — use the `writing-clearly-and-concisely` skill.
